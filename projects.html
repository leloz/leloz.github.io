            </div>
	
	 <div class="description-herbs1" >
		        <h2> Parsley:</h2>
		 <p class="container"> Parsley is a mild bitter herb that can enhance the flavor of your foods.
			Many consider parsley just to be a curly green garnish for food,
			  but it actually helps things like stews achieve a more balanced flavor.
			  As an added benefit, parsley can aid in digestion. Parsley is often grown as an annual,
			  but in milder climates, it will stay evergreen all winter long. Parsley plants will grow to be large and bushy.
			  Parsley is a good source of Vitamins A and C.  </p> </div>

		<h2> Mint:</h2>
                           <p  class="description-herbs2"> There are several varieties of mint. You can use it in drinks like mojitos or mint juleps. Or add some mint to your summer iced tea.
			 Mint freshens the breath and will help to calm your stomach. But if you grow mint, 
			 remember that it’s considered an invasive plant. Mint will spread and take over your garden. It’s best grown in containers.</p></div>
		 
		<div  class="description-herbs3">  
			<h2>Basil</h2>
                         <p> Whether you choose large leaf Italian basis or large purple sweet basil, 
			 this plant is popular in many cuisines but is a feature in Italian cooking like pizzas, salads, 
			 sauces, and pesto. Some people think basil is great for planting alongside your tomatoes but there’s 
			 no real evidence that it makes your tomatoes taste sweeter.
			Basil has health benefits of antioxidants and is a defense against low blood sugar.</p></div>
	
	
		<div  class="description-herbs4">
			<h2>Rosemary</h2>
                        <p> Rosemary is one of the most flavorful herbs and is great for adding to things like poultry, meats, and vegetables. Around Christmastime,
			 you’ll see tree-shaped rosemary bushes for sale. You can bring them home and keep them for planting in the spring. 
			 The fragrant plant is a delightful scent and is sometimes used in floral arrangements. Rosemary likes its soil a bit on the dry side, 
			 so be careful not to overwater. Allowed to flourish,
			 a rosemary plant will grow into a full-sized bush. For more guidedance, be sure to check out this guide titled.</p></div>
	
	
	<div  class="description-herbs5">
		<h2>Thyme </h2>
                         <p>Thyme is a delicate looking plant. It is often used for flavoring egg, bean and vegetable dishes.
			 Thyme is frequently used in the Mediterranean, Italian and Provençal French cuisines. Pair it with lamb, poultry, 
			 and tomatoes. Thyme is often added to soups and stews.
			 Thyme is part of the mint family. The most common variety is garden thyme which has gray-green leaves and a minty, somewhat lemony smell.</p></div>
	
	
		<div  class="description-herbs6"> 
			<h2> Chamomile </h2>
                       <p>  In the United States and Europe, chamomile is most often used as an ingredient in herbal tea. 
			 It is one of the world’s most widely consumed herbal teas. But it has also been used for thousands of years as a traditional medicine for settling 
			 stomachs and calming the nerves. Chamomile also helps reduce inflammation and treat fevers. You can grow either German chamomile or Roman chamomile.
			 The two are interchangeable when it comes to making tea, but they are grown very differently. German chamomile is an annual plant that grows up to three feet tall.
			 Roman chamomile is a perennial but only grows to about a foot high. German chamomile is more commonly known for its blossoms.</p> </div>
	
	<div  class="description-herbs7">
		<h2>Catnip:</h2>
                       <p>  What’s more fun than seeing the family cat go slightly berserk over the smell of catnip? But catnip is more than a feline stimulant.
			It can be used as a relaxing agent as well as a diuretic and laxative. If you plant catnip outside, remember that cats do love to roll in it and chew on it.
			But keeping catnip in your garden can also be a deterrent for rodents. If the cat’s around, the pests most likely won’t be. </p></div>
